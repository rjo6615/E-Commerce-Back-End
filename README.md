# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

While learning web development it is important to understand and utalize routes and mySQL.
This project allowed me to display my skills in creating routes and using mySQL through the creation of a E-Commerce-Back-End application, where
a user is able to get, create, and delete products, categories and tags.

## Installation

To run this project, the user needs to download the project then open the terminal and move to the main folder of the project. To run the program, the user must first create the database by running "source ./db/schema.sql" in the integrated terminal. Then the user must run "npm run seed" to seed the database. After that, type "npm start" into the terminal. After, you can check the functionality of the routes using insomnia at
http://localhost:3001.

## Usage

To use this project, start by typing "npm start" into the terminal. A message in the terminal will say "App listening at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€". Open the link in insomnia and the application is ready to go.
